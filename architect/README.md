# Vagrant Jekyll - v0.2-dev
Vagrant environment for Jekyll and Github Pages Sites.

## Important Notes
**This repository is in initial stages of development.**
Feel free to use it, fork it, improve it and even contribute to it.
However, this is by far not final until version 1.0 is released. It is
imperative that you have prior experience and understanding of vagrant
until this repository is in a production and tested stage.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to satisfy my personal requirements to have an
easy setup for launching and maintaining github pages powered sites and blogs.

At the same time of developing this project, I'm working on a similar, yet
more inclusive project, hence, certain features may seem either a bit out of place or not in a logical structure. This is so they can both be adapted. The production release will be in a desired state and structure.

**Watch the repository**
I aim to develop something a lot better than this to assist in building,
maintaining and deploying github pages sites. If interested, then simply watch this repository or follow me for updates.
